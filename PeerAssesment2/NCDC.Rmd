========================================================


First the whole data is loaded,
Since we will be comparing just the damage and injuries data, some of the other information is unnecesary for this analysis.
So, we subset the data so only the columns we are interested in remain. 
Immedately after, the events which produced no damages or fatalities nor injuries are also removed.

```{r loadfile,cache=TRUE}
stormdata <- read.csv("repdata_data_StormData.csv.bz2")
```

```{r processrawdata}
wanted_cols = c("BGN_DATE","BGN_TIME","END_DATE","END_TIME","LENGTH","WIDTH","F","MAG","EVTYPE","FATALITIES","INJURIES","PROPDMG","PROPDMGEXP","CROPDMG","CROPDMGEXP","WFO","REFNUM")
simple_storm_data <- stormdata[,wanted_cols]
simple_storm_data <- simple_storm_data[(simple_storm_data$PROPDMG >0 | simple_storm_data$CROPDMG>0 | simple_storm_data$INJURIES>0 | simple_storm_data$FATALITIES >0),]
```
